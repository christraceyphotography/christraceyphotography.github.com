<span>Exploring many scenic places on my adventures I love sharing my discoveries. I discovered this phrase on the back of a ski resort map and it captures perfectly what I experience and strive to share.</span>

<span>'My moments of keenest satisfaction and most complete mental peace have been those when the grandeur of nature's artistry has cast its spell over me' <br/><br/>- Clarence Mills</span>
