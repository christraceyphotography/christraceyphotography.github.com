<span>'My moments of keenest satisfaction and most complete mental peace have been those when the grandeur of nature's artistry has cast its spell over me' <br/><br/>- Clarence Mills</span>

<span> On my adventures I have explored awesome scenic environments, I found this quote on the back of a ski resort map and feel it expresses perfectly what I feel and strive to capture for more to experience.</span>
